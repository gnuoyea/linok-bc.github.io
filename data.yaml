bio: | 
  I am a third-year undergaduate at [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/) pursuing degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics. I am fortunate to work under [Professor Donglai Wei](https://donglaiw.github.io/) in the BC Computer Vision Lab, focusing primarily on solving segmentation tasks in support of the natural sciences."

  Around campus, I have established myself as a regular at the [BC Machine Intelligence Group](https://github.com/BCMIG) and competed in the BC Competitive Programming Team for two years. In addition, I have served as a teaching assistant for the Biomedical Image Analysis class in the BC Computer Science department.

  I currently work on vesicle segmentation in electron microscopy (EM) images, as well as help maintain documentation for the [PyTorch Connectomics](https://connectomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) project. Previosuly, I collaborated with [Professor Yu-Tsun Shao](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Shao/Yu--Tsun) on the automated segmentation of merons and antimerons in EM images.
